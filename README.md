# Document_IE

This repo use GCN to extract entities from semi-structured document.

The main refrence : https://github.com/tkipf/gcn.   

For quickly verify GCN's powerful ability of adjoining neighbours, I only use word bag to express a span sentence currently. Indeed, we can also deal a span sentence with lstm or transformer and use the final ouput to express it as the aftering GCN's input.     

I'm adding lstm/transformer+GCN method for box level predict on sroie infomation extract task3. I will upload it soon.
